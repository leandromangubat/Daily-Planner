# Daily Planner
The Daily Planner is used to keep track of time in order to manage daily activities for every hour of the day. 

## Usage

Each block represents an hour displayed on the left side of the block. The block for the current time will be highlighted in red, any time before the current hour will be highlighted in grey, and any future hours will be highlighted in green. Activities for the day can be logged in a block with the appropriate time that you plan to do the activity for that hour.

Each block will have a save icon on the right side of the block. The save icon will save the logged activity for that block.

As time passes on, blocks will change color depending on the hour.
